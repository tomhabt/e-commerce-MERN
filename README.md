## Description

As you know, e-commerce is a huge part of the web development landscape. This project will introduce  several important e-commerce concepts and technologies while also building on concepts of MERN application.
This project can demonstrate how the state condition is met in every and each component and page. It has a future development plan to have a payment collection sysytem and shopping cart. If you get a repo under my github by shop - shop, that is the refactored version of this project with having a shopping cart with strip payment method and code is made to manage state in global state.
